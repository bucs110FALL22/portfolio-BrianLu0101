# CS110 Midterm Exam

## Short Description
A simple meteor shower.

## Known Bugs and Incomplete Parts
Nope

## References
Nope

## Miscellaneous Comments
meteor() function is longer than 10 lines because the streaks utilize the x,y list values in the determination of meteors for x[i] and y[o]. If I try to move the streaks into its own function and build off the already given meteor location, I would have to move the i and o variable out of the meteor() but that ends up with an error referencing a variable before its assignment since the streaks also utilize x[i] and y[o].
