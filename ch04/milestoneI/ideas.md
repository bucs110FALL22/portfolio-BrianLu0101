# Final Project Milestone #1

[Final Project Description](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3zgypVjPjzXl4pL1_Wpjvp3GLCW9zcFydkwUjNfNUA/edit?usp=sharing)

In order to start the Final Project for the course, you will need to decide on the following (remember, nothing is set in stone yet).

Review the sample Final Projects listed below and come up with 3 possible ideas of your own for your final project. Complete this document in **your** portfolio (CH 4). A few things to note:

1. ***Don't limit yourself***
    * I will help you scale it to something manageable, but it is  uch easier to scake something down than to scale up. Shoot for the stars.

2. ***Your idea WILL change, don't worry about the details yet.***
    * Just think of a general type of game, simulation, or other kind of program you would like to create.

***

For each one below you should have a basic description of a program idea, a couple of sentences at least. You can add as much info here as you like. This is where you want to brainstorm a little, and nothing is *'wrong'*.

## Project Idea 1

General RPG game involving common mechanics like player and enemy status, items, and equipments. Implement gameplay mechanics like attack, block, sprint, dash, etc. Undecided on the environment type whether it would be open world, free roam, battle-only, rogue-like, etc. Game with graphics.

## Project Idea 2

A timer application that has various time related features like that of the phone application or like Windows Alarm and Clock application. Things like stopwatch, timer, clock, timezone converter, etc.

## Project Idea 3

A very basic text based adventure game. Simplistic and beginner-friendly but not exactly something difficult to achieve compared to idea 1. Backup for if idea 1 or 2 is too much work.
